# DSA-210-SPRING
# 📌 DSA210 - Obesity & Mental Health Analysis

## Introduction
Hello, I am Nil Akıner (32685). This project is prepared for the DSA210 course during the Spring 2025 semester.

## Project Overview
Obesity is a major global health issue influenced by psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors. I believe obesity is one of the most significant health issues of our time, and given today’s global conditions, psychology and living standards play a direct or indirect role in its prevalence, perhaps even in a mutually influential way.  

This project aims to examine how mental health, stress, and lifestyle contribute to various issues, such as obesity**. I plan to explore their relationships and prevalence across different populations, and perhaps in relation to gender.
